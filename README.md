# SDL_remixer

## Archived!

This work is now at [SDL_mixer's GitHub](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer).

SDL_remixer was a temporary repository where I was working on an SDL_mixer
rewrite.

That work is now complete, and this code has become SDL3_mixer!

This repo is archived, to retain revision history, issues, etc, and future
development has moved to SDL_mixer's main branch.

So go visit [SDL_mixer](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL_mixer) instead!
